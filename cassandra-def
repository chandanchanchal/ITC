i. Anti-Entropy
The mechanism that ensures that every node contains update data.

ii. Bigtable
It is one of a base for the creation of Cassandra. It was created at Google in 2006 as a high-performance database system.

iii. Bloom Filter
It is an algorithm that determines if an element is a member of a particular set.

iv. Cassandra
Open-source, distributed database management system that handles a big set of data.

v. Cluster
Cassandra Cluster is a collection of many nodes. Many clusters together form a database.

vi. Column
It is the basic or the innermost unit in the database. It contains the main data or information.

vii. Column Families
It is a storage unit in keyspace. We can consider it as a table. It contains rows and columns, that in turn, contains the data.

viii. Commit Log
It is basically a median to enter the data in Memtable an SSTable. Before going to the Memtable and SSTable, the data is stored in the commit log. This ensures that at the time of failure, the data is not lost.

ix. Compaction
It is a process that basically compresses the storage. It basically merges large files and frees up space.

x. Consistency Level
This allows the user to set the number of replicas in a cluster. In these replicas, the data is copied and it increases the redundancies.

xi. Dynamo
It is the other base of Cassandra. This along with principles of Bigtable led to the creation of Cassandra.

xii. Failure Detection
It is the process of determining the nodes that have experienced failure in a cluster.

xiii. Fault-Tolerant
It is the capacity of the database system to handle faults.


xiv. Keyspace
It is a storage unit in a database. Basically, it is the outermost container in a node. It contains many column families.

xv. Memtable
It is a storage table representation. The data flow here after going through the committable. After this, the data flush to disk as an SSTable.

xvi. Node
It basically represents a system. They contain many column families that contain data.

xvii. NoSQL
Cassandra NoSQL basically determines the collection of non-sequential data. In other words, it is a non-relational data.

xviii. Primary key
It is a row that basically determines the main row.

xix. Replication
It is a process in which the data is copied from one node to another. This process ensures redundancies.

xx. Replication Factor
It determines the number of replicas that are created in a cluster of a given data.

xxi. Replication Strategy
Basically, the strategy that used to carry out replication in the cluster.

xxii. Row
It is a storage unit. It is a part of column family and contains many columns.

xxiii. Seed Node
It is a kind of a node which is basically used by newly added nodes to get up and running.

xxiv. SSTable
A Sort string table. It allows high performance and can be compacted.

xxv. SuperColumn
It is a column which is basically a map of other columns. In one kind it contains all the columns.

xxvi. Thrift
An API that uses when user deals with the table as a storage unit.

xxvii. Timestamp
Timestamp are column values that basically is given by the user. It determines the time of a column details.
